# What I Learned

As this is my first fullstack interactive app, I faced alot of challenges. I learned how to render each and every componenets, how to cnnect the backend to the frontend, and also backend to the database. I really had the trouble with the connection backend to the frontend. 

In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to use the knex.raw . 

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
